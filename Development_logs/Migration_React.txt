Tasks Completed:
- Initial Migration to React:
    Migrated the index.js and its related content from EJS to React.
    Implemented a functional structure for React with dynamic rendering of components using JSON files.

- Navbar Implementation:
    Created a fully functional Navbar using React-Bootstrap.
    Integrated dropdown menus and navigation links that dynamically scroll to specific sections of the page.

- Dynamic Rendering with JSON:
    Converted hardcoded data in the original EJS files into structured JSON.
    Ensured all dynamic content in the index page (e.g., sections, titles, and images) is rendered dynamically using reusable components.

- Main Sections:
    Developed reusable section components (Section, MainDescriptionSection, and GalleryCarousel) for the index page.
    Successfully rendered the content of the Home page, including dynamic image galleries and descriptions.

- Basic CSS Styling:
    Adapted key CSS styles for React compatibility.
    Styled the Navbar, carousel, and main sections to resemble the original design.

Challenges Faced:

- Dynamic Data Management:
    Problem: Handling dynamic data while keeping components reusable and organized.
    Solution: Structured the project to load content dynamically via JSON files, ensuring all components rely on props for data input.
    Bootstrap Integration:

    Problem: Ensuring React-Bootstrap components worked seamlessly with existing styles and functionality.
    Solution: Verified correct imports for react-bootstrap components and adjusted custom styles to avoid conflicts.

- Navigation and Routing:
    Problem: Setting up smooth navigation between sections of the page using React-Router.
    Solution: Successfully implemented routing for internal links, ensuring smooth scrolling and correct targeting.
    Carousel Customization:

    Problem: Styling the gallery carousel to match the original layout while keeping captions responsive.
    Solution: Applied custom CSS to adjust image scaling, caption placement, and overall responsiveness.
