#Pesonal log: Carlos Jimenez Zepeda 

For this deliverable, my primary focus was on integrating Node.js and Express into the project, ensuring that everything ran smoothly after the switch. 
I also prepared the backend for transitioning the views to EJS and set up MongoDB integration. 
Additionally, I improved the page layout using Bootstrap for better visuals and functionality.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed:
  I successfully migrated the project to Node.js and Express, which required adjusting the routing system. 
  I also set up the backend, ensuring it could handle upcoming changes, such as adding MongoDB and switching to EJS for templating. 
  A significant challenge arose when updating the Bootstrap version, as certain components didn’t work well with the older version we were using. 
  However, by consulting the documentation, I resolved these issues and enhanced the design and functionality.
  Another task I focused on was paginating a table that handles around 12,000 records. 
  Initially, I encountered difficulties, but with the help of tutorials, I managed to implement it effectively.

- Personal Reflection:
  This experience further solidified my preference for backend development. 
  Front-end tasks, particularly involving design, are not my strong suit, but thanks to my teammates, I was able to overcome these obstacles. 
  My work on backend improvements was efficient and satisfying, and I avoided many mistakes thanks to prior experiences with the portfolio.

  Overall, I am pleased with my contributions. The migration to Node.js and Express went smoothly, 
  and I resolved several complex issues efficiently. I feel that my backend skills helped the project progress quickly, 
  particularly with the pagination and database management aspects.

Reflection on Teammates’ Work: My teammates have been incredibly helpful, especially with the front-end design. 
Their input has been invaluable, and the team’s collaborative spirit is helping us tackle the project’s challenges effectively.

##### Final deliverable #####

For this deliverable, my primary focus was on migrating all components from EJS to React components.
This required not only restructuring the codebase but also ensuring that the separation between backend and frontend was clear and functional. 
After completing the migration, I successfully connected the backend and frontend to enable seamless data exchange. 
Additionally, I implemented a simple validation feature to enhance the application’s functionality.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed:
  I successfully migrated the entire project’s components from EJS to React. 
  This transition required a significant restructuring of the codebase and a deep understanding of React's component-based architecture.
  I ensured a clean separation of concerns by decoupling the backend from the frontend and establishing a reliable connection between the two.
  To enhance the user experience and ensure data integrity, I added a straightforward validation feature.
  These changes required careful testing to ensure that the application continued to function smoothly after the migration.

- Personal Reflection:
  This deliverable was both challenging and rewarding. Migrating to React allowed me to strengthen my understanding of modern frontend frameworks, which was a significant growth opportunity.

Their strengths in different areas complemented my work, making it easier to overcome challenges. The team’s cohesive efforts ensured that the project progressed smoothly, and their support on frontend tasks was particularly helpful.


#Personal log Martin Garcia

During this deliverable I was focused in checking the progress of the page and
the changing in the website. Also I help with the part of the desing and 
deleting some extra info that is irrelevant.

Task Failed:
I tried to implement some bootstrap in the proyect, trying that some images
deploy información and grafics but i couldnt make it right and i ended update
deleting all the bootstrap try.

Personal Reflection: In the delivery i think that my aportation were cero but, at the end i was helping not only with thee code
or creating the repository, but i help my team seeing some issues with the page, like the color, the format, helping with some issues
that my team have with some anchors and the display.

Performance Evaluation: I feel that i didnt work as much as my teamates, but thinking in deep all the things we change in the pryect 
since the begining i think that my work was more in the ideas and the supervision more than making the web.

Reflection on teamates Work: My team is the best they work in time and in forms also they make this possible and all 
their ideas were creative and all posible.


##### Second deliverable #####

In this deliverable I make sure the page was still good looking and also practical, ensuring that all the new implementations like mongo or the methods were
correct and that they do not cause conflicts or errors, also I help with the desing.

Task Completed:

I successfully implemented a confirmation window for downloading the document containing the lake data, which also checks if the file cannot be downloaded or is missing. 
Additionally, I implemented arrows in the tables to help devices navigate through the entire table in case it is not fully displayed on the screen.

Personal Reflection:
During this deliverable, I was able to better understand the backend as well as successfully integrate it with the frontend, and reinforce my knowledge of databases.
Even though I didn’t dive too deep into the backend, I observed the process of connecting everything we had in HTML to EJS. Not to mention, we had to make several modifications 
to ensure the page continued to look good,
 improving some visual aspects along the way.

 Performance Evaluation:
 In this deliverable, I felt that I contributed more directly, making pushes to the repository and modifying some backend aspects even though it's not my strong suit.

 Reflection on Teammates: 
 I believe my team and I complement each other very well. Not to mention, they are very skilled in both backend and frontend respectively. Especially, our colleague Carlos tends to 
 work a lot and puts a lot of effort into making the project the best it can be, which allows for implementing some changes easily. And Andres makes very good design decisions.

 ##### Final deliverable #####

 For the final deliverable I help my team adding some of the part of the page that were in the ejs to the react enviroment, and adding extra things of react to the page.

 Task Completed:
 I implement the download button using react and the context enviroment variables.

 Task Completed: 
 implementing new grafics where the data is coming from our database, using the react Grafs component

 Task Completed: 
 Adding an error handling page, so when an error happends the page shows this page with information about the error.

 Personal Reflection: 
 In this part of the proyect I feel i was more involved that ever, and my teamates help a lot with things i didnt understand or I cant implement in the webpage
 also it was a challenge to understand the context part for me but I think I manage to overcome the problems that this part generate me to complete the components
 of the webpage

 Performance Evaluation:
 I think my performance was good not the best but I do more commits to the project in comparison to the other deliverables, so I believe I did great and my contributions
 were good to the project.

 Reflection On Teammates:
 As always, my teammates did a great job, from Carlos taking on the whole backend and Andres helping to style the page. And the great dynamic we had as a team was evident
since there were no problems beyond bugs or compilation errors.


 #Pesonal log: Andres Gonzalez Gomez

My main focus during this face of the project was visual design and usage of color. Since 
functionality isn't our priority yet, I tried to make the visual aspect of the website as 
polished as possible.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed: I used the bases we built to create a cleaner page using a specific 
color scheme and visual elements for the structure of the items. I searched for useful 
assets in bootstrap and modified them to our needs.

- Personal Reflection: Since I am better at design than back-end programming I will use 
those skills to make myself useful. I'll be working with data in future deliveries while
keeping the aesthetic of our webpage.

- Performance Evaluation: I'd say my performance wasn't as good as I would've like'd it to
be, since I've been short on time this past weeks. However, I try to work on this proyect 
whenever I can and I'm in constant contact with my team to discuss it.

Reflection on Teammates' Work: My team's performance has been more than ideal since they're
both willing to go that extra mile so our proyect has the quality we want. They are great
programmers and I look forward to what we can create as a team.


##### Second delivery #####

For this delivery I tried focusing on using the EJS methods learnt in class, adapting the 
existing files to a new structure. I checked the frontend of the code so it translated 
correctly to the new server files. Helping with the investigation needed was key for 
this specific delivery.

Self-Assessment:

- Tasks Completed: I adapted some of the bootstrap assets needed so they fit the needs of 
our project. Besides that, I mostly helped with the transitioning to Node.js, due to the 
fact that the whole structure of the project needed to change.

- Personal Reflection: I mostly helped investigating a lot of the information needed and 
how the libraries could be implemented as required. Since my understanding of MongoDB isn't 
that deep, I trusted my teammates to take care of the things they felt more confortable working on.

- Performance Evaluation: Yet again, I feel like I could always be more involved in the 
technical areas of this delivery. I'd like to think my work was helpful enough to my 
teammates but I'll try to be even more usefull.

Reflection on Teammates' Work: My team's performance is outstanding. They are always prepared 
to work as much as the assigned delivery asks us to. They have a lot of knowledge and 
experience using this methods so their workflow was really smooth and efficient.
